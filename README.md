Intel(R) Deep Learning Streamer Pipeline Server (Intel(R) DL Streamer Pipeline Server) is a python package and microservice for
deploying optimized media analytics pipelines. It supports pipelines
defined in
[GStreamer](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/?gi-language=c)*
or [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/)* and provides APIs to discover, start,
stop, customize and monitor pipeline execution. Video Analytics
Serving is based on [OpenVINO<sup>&#8482;</sup> Toolkit DL
Streamer](https://github.com/opencv/gst-video-analytics) and [FFmpeg
Video Analytics](https://github.com/VCDP/FFmpeg-patch).

## Features Include:
| |                  |
|---------------------------------------------|------------------|
| **Customizable Media Analytics Containers** | Scripts and dockerfiles to build and run container images with the required dependencies for hardware optimized media analytics pipelines. |
| **No-Code Pipeline Definitions and Templates** | JSON based definition files, a flexible way for developers to define and parameterize pipelines while abstracting the low level details from their users. |
| **Deep Learning Model Integration** | A simple way to package and reference [OpenVINO<sup>&#8482;</sup>](https://software.intel.com/en-us/openvino-toolkit) based models in pipeline definitions. The precision of a model can be auto-selected at runtime based on the chosen inference device. |
| **Intel(R) DL Streamer Pipeline Server Python API** | A python module to discover, start, stop, customize and monitor pipelines based on their no-code definitions. |

# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

| |                  |
|---------------------------------------------|------------------|
| **Docker** | Intel(R) DL Streamer Pipeline Server requires Docker for its build, development, and runtime environments. Please install the latest for your platform. [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install). |
| **bash** | Intel(R) DL Streamer Pipeline Server's build and run scripts require bash and have been tested on systems using versions greater than or equal to: `GNU bash, version 4.3.48(1)-release (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu)`. Most users shouldn't need to update their version but if you run into issues please install the latest for your platform. Instructions for macOS&reg;* users [here](docs/installing_bash_macos.md). |

## Supported Hardware

Refer to [OpenVINO<sup>&#8482;</sup> System Requirements](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/tools/openvino-toolkit/system-requirements.html) for supported development and target runtime platforms and the [OpenVINO<sup>&#8482;</sup> Container Release Notes](https://hub.docker.com/r/openvino/ubuntu20_data_runtime) for details on providing access to accelerator devices.

## Building the Microservice

Build the sample microservice with the following command:

```bash
./docker/build.sh
```

The script will automatically include the sample models, pipelines and
required dependencies.

To verify the build succeeded execute the following command:

```bash
docker images dlstreamer-pipeline-server-gstreamer:latest
```

Expected output:

```bash
REPOSITORY                          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
dlstreamer-pipeline-server-gstreamer   latest              f51f2695639f        2 minutes ago          3.03GB
```

## Running the Microservice

Start the sample microservice with the following command:

```bash
./docker/run.sh -v /tmp:/tmp
```

This script issues a standard docker run command to launch the
container, run a Tornado based web service on port 8080, and mount the
`/tmp` folder. The `/tmp` folder is mounted to share sample
results with the host and is optional in actual deployments.

Expected output:

## Running a Pipeline
VA Serving includes a sample client [vaclient](./vaclient/README.md) that can connect to the service and make requests. We will use vaclient to explain how to use the key microservice features.
> **Note:** Any RESTful tool or library can be used to send requests to the VA Serving service. We are using vaclient as it simplifies interaction with the service.

> **Note:**  The microservice has to be up and running before the sample client is invoked.

Before running a pipeline, we need to know what pipelines are available. We do this using vaclient's `list-pipeline` command.
In new shell run the following command:
```bash
./vaclient/vaclient.sh list-pipelines
 ```
 ```
 - object_detection/person_vehicle_bike
 - object_classification/vehicle_attributes
 - audio_detection/environment
 - object_tracking/person_vehicle_bike
```
> **Note:** The pipelines you will see may differ slightly

Pipelines are displayed as a name/version tuple. The name reflects the action and version supplies more details of that action. Let's go with `object_detection/person_vehicle_bike`. Now we need to choose a media source. We recommend the [IoT Devkit sample videos](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/sample-videos) to get started. As the pipeline version indicates support for detecting people, person-bicycle-car-detection.mp4 would be a good choice.
> **Note:** Make sure to include `raw=true` parameter in the Github URL as shown in our examples. Failure to do so will result in a pipeline execution error.

vaclient offers a `run` command that takes two additional arguments the `pipeline` and the `uri` for the media source. The `run` command displays inference results until either the media is exhausted or `CTRL+C` is pressed.

Inference result bounding boxes are displayed in the format `label (confidence) [top left width height] {meta-data}` provided applicable data is present. At the end of the pipeline run, the average fps is shown.
```
./vaclient/vaclient.sh run object_detection/person_vehicle_bike https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/sample-videos/blob/master/person-bicycle-car-detection.mp4?raw=true
```
```

avg_fps: 39.66
```
> **NOTE:** Inference results are not obtained via a REST API but read from an output file.
The file path is specified in the `destination` section of the REST request and will be discussed in a later section.

## Pipeline States
### Queued, Running and Completed
The vaclient `run` command starts the pipeline. The underlying REST request returns a `pipeline instance` which is used to query the state of the pipeline.
All being well it will go into `QUEUED` then `RUNNING` state. We can interrogate the pipeline status by using the vaclient `start` command that kicks off the pipeline like `run` and then exits displaying the `pipeline instance` (a [UUID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier)) which is used by the `status` command to view pipeline state.
> **NOTE:** The pipeline instance value depends on the number of pipelines started while the server is running so may differ from the value shown in the following examples.

```
./vaclient/vaclient.sh start object_detection/person_vehicle_bike https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/sample-videos/blob/master/person-bicycle-car-detection.mp4?raw=true
```
```
<snip>
Starting pipeline object_detection/person_vehicle_bike, instance = d83502e3ef314e8fbec8dc926eadd0c2
```
You will need both the pipeline tuple and `instance` id for the status command. This command will display pipeline state:
```
./vaclient/vaclient.sh status object_detection/person_vehicle_bike d83502e3ef314e8fbec8dc926eadd0c2
```
```
<snip>
RUNNING
```
Then wait for a minute or so and try again. Pipeline will be completed.
```
./vaclient/vaclient.sh status object_detection/person_vehicle_bike d83502e3ef314e8fbec8dc926eadd0c2
```
```
<snip>
COMPLETED
```
### Aborted
If a pipeline is stopped, rather than allowed to complete, it goes into the ABORTED state.
Start the pipeline again, this time we'll stop it.
```
./vaclient/vaclient.sh start object_detection/person_vehicle_bike https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/sample-videos/blob/master/person-bicycle-car-detection.mp4?raw=true
```
```
<snip>
Starting pipeline object_detection/person_vehicle_bike, instance = 8ad2c85af4bd473e8a693aff562be316
```
```
./vaclient/vaclient.sh status object_detection/person_vehicle_bike 8ad2c85a-f4bd473e8a693aff562be316
```
```
<snip>
RUNNING
```
```
./vaclient/vaclient.sh stop object_detection/person_vehicle_bike 8ad2c85af4bd473e8a693aff562be316
```
```
<snip>
Stopping Pipeline...
Pipeline stopped
avg_fps: 24.33
```
```
./vaclient/vaclient.sh status object_detection/person_vehicle_bike 8ad2c85af4bd473e8a693aff562be316
```
```
<snip>
ABORTED
```
### Error
The error state covers a number of outcomes such as the request could not be satisfied, a pipeline dependency was missing or an initialization problem. We can create an error condition by supplying a valid but unreachable uri.
```
./vaclient/vaclient.sh start object_detection/person_vehicle_bike http://bad-uri
```
```
<snip>
Starting pipeline object_detection/person_vehicle_bike, instance = 2bb2d219-310a4ee881faf258fbcc4355
```
Note that VA Serving does not report an error at this stage as it goes into `QUEUED` state before it realizes that the source is not providing media.
Checking on state a few seconds later will show the error.
```
./vaclient/vaclient.sh status object_detection/person_vehicle_bike 2bb2d219310a4ee881faf258fbcc4355
```
```
<snip>
ERROR
```

## Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP)
RTSP allows you to connect to a server and display a video stream. VA Serving includes an RTSP server that creates a stream that shows the incoming video with superimposed bounding boxes and meta-data. You will need a client that connects to the server and displays the video. We recommend [vlc](https://www.videolan.org/). For this example we'll assume VA Serving and vlc are running on the same host.

First start VA Serving with RTSP enabled. By default, the RTSP stream will use port 8554.
```
docker/run.sh --enable-rtsp -v /tmp:/tmp
```
Then start a pipeline specifying the RTSP server endpoint path `pipeline-server`. In this case the RTSP endpoint would be `rtsp://localhost:8554/pipeline-server`
```
./vaclient/vaclient.sh run object_detection/person_vehicle_bike https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/sample-videos/blob/master/person-bicycle-car-detection.mp4?raw=true --rtsp-path pipeline-server
```
If you see the error
```
Starting pipeline object_detection/person_vehicle_bike, instance = <uuid>
Error in pipeline, please check pipeline-server log messages
```
You probably forgot to enable RTSP in the server.

Now start `vlc` and from the `Media` menu select `Open Network Stream`. For URL enter `rtsp://localhost:8554/pipeline-server` and hit `Play`.
> **Note:** The pipeline must be running before you hit play otherwise VLC will not be able to connect to the RTSP server.

> **Note:** For shorter video files you should have VLC ready to go before starting pipeline otherwise by the time you hit play the pipeline will have completed and the RTSP server will have shut down.

# Request Customizations
## Change Pipeline and Source Media
With vaclient it is easy to customize service requests. Here will use a vehicle classification pipeline `object_classification/vehicle_attributes` with the Iot Devkit video `car-detection.mp4`. Note how vaclient now displays classification metadata including type and color of vehicle.
```
./vaclient/vaclient.sh run object_classification/vehicle_attributes https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/sample-videos/blob/master/car-detection.mp4?raw=true
```
```
Starting pipeline object_classification/vehicle_attributes, instance = <uuid>
Pipeline running
<snip>
Timestamp 18080000000
- vehicle (1.00) [0.41, 0.00, 0.57, 0.33] {'color': 'red', 'type': 'car'}
Timestamp 18160000000
- vehicle (1.00) [0.41, 0.00, 0.57, 0.31] {'color': 'red', 'type': 'car'}
- vehicle (0.50) [0.09, 0.92, 0.27, 1.00] {'color': 'white', 'type': 'van'}
Timestamp 18240000000
- vehicle (1.00) [0.40, 0.00, 0.57, 0.27] {'color': 'red', 'type': 'car'}
Timestamp 18320000000
- vehicle (1.00) [0.40, 0.00, 0.56, 0.24] {'color': 'red', 'type': 'car'}
Timestamp 18400000000
- vehicle (1.00) [0.40, 0.00, 0.56, 0.22] {'color': 'red', 'type': 'car'}
- vehicle (0.53) [0.52, 0.19, 0.98, 0.99] {'color': 'black', 'type': 'truck'}
Timestamp 18480000000
- vehicle (0.99) [0.40, 0.00, 0.56, 0.20] {'color': 'red', 'type': 'car'}
- vehicle (0.81) [0.69, 0.00, 1.00, 0.36] {'color': 'black', 'type': 'bus'}
Timestamp 18560000000
- vehicle (1.00) [0.40, 0.00, 0.55, 0.18] {'color': 'red', 'type': 'car'}
- vehicle (0.71) [0.70, 0.00, 1.00, 0.36] {'color': 'black', 'type': 'bus'}
Timestamp 18640000000
- vehicle (0.98) [0.40, 0.00, 0.55, 0.15] {'color': 'red', 'type': 'car'}
```
If you look at video you can see that there are some errors in classification - there are no trucks or busses in the video. However you can see that associated confidence is much lower than the correct classification of the white and red cars.

## Change Inference Accelerator Device
Inference accelerator devices can be easily selected using the device parameter. Here we run the car classification pipeline again,
but this time use the integrated GPU for detection inference by setting the `detection-device` parameter.
```
./vaclient/vaclient.sh run object_classification/vehicle_attributes https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/sample-videos/blob/master/car-detection.mp4?raw=true --parameter detection-device GPU --parameter detection-model-instance-id person_vehicle_bike_detection_gpu
```
```
Starting pipeline object_classification/vehicle_attributes, instance = <uuid>
```
> **Note:** The GPU inference plug-in dynamically builds OpenCL kernels when it is first loaded resulting in a ~30s delay before inference results are produced.

> **Note:** The `detection-model-instance-id` parameter caches the GPU model with a unique id. For more information read about [model instance ids](docs/defining_pipelines.md#model-persistance-in-openvino-gstreamer-elements).

vaclient's fps measurement is useful when assessing pipeline performance with different accelerators.

## View REST Request
As the previous example has shown, the vaclient application works by converting command line arguments into VA Serving REST requests.
The `--show-request` option displays the REST verb, uri and body in the request.
Let's repeat the previous GPU inference example, adding RTSP output and show the underlying request.
```
./vaclient/vaclient.sh run object_classification/vehicle_attributes https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/sample-videos/blob/master/car-detection.mp4?raw=true --parameter detection-device GPU --rtsp-path pipeline-server --show-request
```
```
<snip>
POST http://localhost:8080/pipelines/object_classification/vehicle_attributes
Body:{'source': {'uri': 'https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/sample-videos/blob/master/car-detection.mp4?raw=true', 'type': 'uri'}, 'destination': {'metadata': {'type': 'file', 'path': '/tmp/results.jsonl', 'format': 'json-lines'}, 'frame': {'type': 'rtsp', 'path': 'pipeline-server'}}, 'parameters': {'detection-device': 'GPU'}}
```
The REST request is broken into three parts
1. VERB: `POST`
1. URI: `http://localhost:8080/pipelines/object_classification/vehicle_attributes`
2. BODY: `{"source": {"uri": ...`

The uri is easy to decode. It's the service address, `pipelines` command and the pipeline tuplet. The body contains three components:
1. The media source
2. The frame and metadata destinations
3. Pipeline parameters.

They are easier to understand when the json is pretty-printed
```
{
  "source": {
    "uri": "https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/sample-videos/blob/master/car-detection.mp4?raw=true",
    "type": "uri"
  },
  "destination": {
    "metadata": {
      "type": "file",
      "path": "/tmp/results.jsonl",
      "format": "json-lines"
    },
    "frame": {
      "type": "rtsp",
      "path": "pipeline-server"
    }
  },
  "parameters": {
    "detection-device": "GPU"
  }
}
```
1. Media source: type is `uri` and the uri is the car-detection.mp4 video
2. Destinations:
   * metadata: this is the inference results, they are sent to file `/tmp/results.jsonl` in `json-lines` format. vaclient parses this file to display the inference results and metadata.
   * frames: this the watermarked frames. Here they are sent to the RTSP server and available over given endpoint `pipeline-server`.
3. Parameters set pipeline properties. See the [Defining Pipelines](docs/defining_pipelines.md) document for more details on parameters.

The `--show-request` output can be easily converted int a curl command.
```
curl <URI> -X <VERB> -H "Content-Type: application/json' -d <BODY>
```
So the above request would be as below. Note the pipeline instance `1` returned by the request.
```bash
curl localhost:8080/pipelines/object_classification/vehicle_attributes -X POST -H \
'Content-Type: application/json' -d \
'{
  "source": {
    "uri": "https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/sample-videos/blob/master/car-detection.mp4?raw=true",
    "type": "uri"
  },
  "destination": {
    "metadata": {
      "type": "file",
      "path": "/tmp/results.jsonl",
      "format": "json-lines"
    },
    "frame": {
      "type": "rtsp",
      "path": "pipeline-server"
    }
  },
  "parameters": {
    "detection-device": "GPU"
  }
}'
```
```

# Changing Pipeline Model
Intel(R) DL Streamer Pipeline Server makes pipeline customization and model selection a simple task. The [Changing Object Detection Models Tutorial](docs/changing_object_detection_models.md) provides step by step instructions for changing the object detection reference pipeline to use a model better suited to a different video source.
